# Extensions:
## Chrome Extension:
* open <a href="chrome://extensions" target="_blank">Chrome > Settings > Extensions</a>
* "Load unpacked extension..", then point to the directory of the ```manifest.json``` file, in this case it's in ```src/client/browsers_extensions/chrome```
* open facebook.com and wait for input fields to augment.

### Buttons logic still fucked up, and nothing actually works, this is just a demo how things can be done, also the extension is not restricted to facebook.com only, so disable it or it will try to fuck up every single input field on evey site you visit
