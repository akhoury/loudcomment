Extensions:
---

to test Chrome Extension:

* open (Chrome > Settings > Extensions)[chrome://extensions/]:
* "Load unpacked extension..", then point to the directory of the ```manifest.json``` file, in this case it's in ```src/client/browsers_extensions/chrome```
* open facebook.com and wait for input fields to augment.
